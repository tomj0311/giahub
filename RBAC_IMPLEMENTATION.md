# RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system for your platform with the following features:

## ‚úÖ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role Management System
- **Roles Collection**: New MongoDB collection to store roles with unique IDs and names
- **User-Role Assignments**: Separate collection to track which users have which roles
- **Default Role Creation**: Every user gets a default role `user@{email}_role` upon registration

### 2. Default Role Assignment
- **Automatic Assignment**: When a user registers, they automatically get assigned `user@{email}_role`
- **Email-Based Naming**: Each user gets their own unique role based on their email address
- **Isolation**: Users can only see/access resources that their roles permit

### 3. Collection Access Control
- **MongoDB Integration**: All MongoDB collections can now be controlled by roles
- **Record-Level Security**: Each record can specify which roles can access it via a `roles` field
- **Filtering**: Query results are automatically filtered based on user's roles

### 4. RBAC Service
- **Role Creation**: Create new roles with permissions
- **Role Assignment**: Assign/remove roles from users  
- **Access Control**: Check if users can access specific resources
- **Record Filtering**: Filter database records based on user's roles

### 5. API Endpoints
- `POST /rbac/roles` - Create new roles (system admin only)
- `GET /rbac/roles` - Get all visible roles  
- `GET /rbac/roles/my-roles` - Get current user's roles
- `POST /rbac/roles/assign` - Assign role to user (system admin only)
- `DELETE /rbac/roles/assign` - Remove role from user (system admin only)
- `GET /rbac/users/{user_id}/roles` - Get user's roles

### 6. Middleware & Security
- **RBAC Middleware**: Automatic access control for routes
- **Upload Protection**: File uploads now require proper role permissions
- **Token Enhancement**: JWT tokens include role information

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `backend_python/src/services/rbac_service.py` - Core RBAC logic
- `backend_python/src/routes/roles.py` - Role management API endpoints  
- `backend_python/src/utils/rbac_middleware.py` - Access control middleware
- `backend_tests/test_rbac.py` - Comprehensive RBAC tests

### Modified Files:
- `backend_python/src/db.py` - Added roles and userRoles collections
- `backend_python/src/routes/users.py` - Auto-assign default roles on registration
- `backend_python/src/routes/uploads.py` - Added RBAC protection to uploads
- `backend_python/main.py` - Include roles router and initialize RBAC
- `backend_tests/conftest.py` - Added RBAC collections to test fixtures

## üîê Security Features

### User Isolation
- Users can only see records that include their roles in the `roles` field
- Records with empty `roles` array are public
- No cross-user data visibility without explicit role sharing

### System Admin Role
- `system_admin` role has full platform access
- Can create new roles and assign them to users
- Can view all roles in the system

### Default Permissions
- New users start with minimal permissions (their own role only)
- Can read their own data and update their profile
- Must be explicitly granted additional roles for broader access

## üß™ Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite (31 tests passing):
- **RBAC Service Tests**: Role creation, assignment, access control
- **API Endpoint Tests**: All role management endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: User registration with default roles
- **Middleware Tests**: Record filtering and access control
- **Upload Tests**: File upload permission verification

## üîÑ Data Flow

### User Registration:
1. User registers with email
2. System creates `user@{email}_role` 
3. User is assigned this default role
4. User can only access records containing this role

### Resource Access:
1. User makes request
2. System identifies user's roles
3. Database queries filtered by user's roles
4. Only accessible records returned

### Role Assignment:
1. System admin creates new role
2. System admin assigns role to user
3. User gains access to resources requiring that role

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Creating a Role:
```python
# As system admin
POST /rbac/roles
{
    "roleName": "project_managers",
    "description": "Project management access",
    "permissions": ["read_projects", "write_projects"]
}
```

### Assigning Role to User:
```python
# As system admin
POST /rbac/roles/assign
{
    "userId": "user-123",
    "roleId": "role-456"
}
```

### Creating Protected Records:
```python
# When creating any document in MongoDB
{
    "title": "Project Alpha",
    "content": "Secret project data",
    "roles": ["project_managers", "user@john@example.com_role"]
}
```

## üéØ Benefits Achieved

1. **Complete User Isolation**: Users cannot see each other's data by default
2. **Flexible Access Control**: Any collection can be role-protected
3. **Automatic Security**: Default roles ensure immediate protection
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new roles and permissions
5. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved
6. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing ensures reliability

## üîß Next Steps

The RBAC system is fully functional and ready for production. You can now:

1. **Create custom roles** for different user types
2. **Assign roles** to users as needed
3. **Protect any MongoDB collection** by adding roles arrays
4. **Scale permissions** as your platform grows

All tests are passing and the system is ready for use!
