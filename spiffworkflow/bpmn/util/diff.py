        changed (dict): a filtered version of comparisons that contains only changed items


    The chief basis for alignment is `TaskSpec.name` (ie, the BPMN ID of the spec): if the IDs are identical,
    it is assumed the task specs correspond.  If a spec in the old version does not have an ID in the new,
    some attempt to match based on inputs and outputs is made.

    The general procdedure is to attempt to align as many tasks based on ID as possible first, and then
    attempt to match by other means while backing out of the traversal.

    Updates are organized primarily by the specs from the original version.
