# Project Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A complete project management system following the OpenProject UI pattern with hierarchical projects, planning features, and dashboard visualization.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Project Portfolio
- **Hierarchical Projects**: Create projects with parent-child relationships
- **Default Root**: All top-level projects are children of "root"
- **Recursive Structure**: Each project can have unlimited child projects
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Navigate through project hierarchy easily
- **Project Attributes**:
  - Name, Description
  - Status (ON_TRACK, AT_RISK, OFF_TRACK, COMPLETED)
  - Priority (Low, Normal, High, Urgent)
  - Assignee & Approver
  - Start Date & Due Date
  - Progress (0-100%)
  - Visibility (Public/Private)

### 2. Project Planning
- **Three Activity Types**:
  - **MILESTONE**: Major project checkpoints (Flag icon)
  - **PHASE**: Project phases (Circle icon)
  - **TASK**: Individual tasks (CheckCircle icon)
  
- **Planning Features**:
  - Due dates with calendar picker
  - Assignees & Approvers
  - Priority levels
  - Status tracking (New, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled)
  - Time estimation & tracking
  - Progress percentage
  - Rich descriptions

- **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for Milestones, Phases, and Tasks

### 3. Project Dashboard
- **Project Overview Card**:
  - Project name, status, description
  - Assignee, due date, priority
  - Overall progress bar

- **Statistics Cards**:
  - Total Activities count
  - Completed Activities (with percentage)
  - Overdue Tasks count
  - Upcoming Milestones (next 30 days)

- **Upcoming Activities List**:
  - Next 5 activities sorted by due date
  - Activity type, status, assignee
  - Quick visual overview

## Architecture

### Backend Structure
```
backend/src/

│   └── project_activity_service.py # Activity business logic
└── routes/
    ├── projects.py                 # Project API endpoints
    └── project_activities.py       # Activity API endpoints
```

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/src/
└── projects/
    ├── Projects.jsx            # Main component with tabs
    ├── ProjectPortfolio.jsx    # Hierarchical project view
    ├── ProjectPlanning.jsx     # Activities (Milestones/Phases/Tasks)
    └── ProjectDashboard.jsx    # Visual dashboard with stats
```

### Database Collections

#### projects
```javascript
{
  name: String,
  description: String,
  parent_id: String,           // "root" or parent project ID
  status: String,              // ON_TRACK, AT_RISK, OFF_TRACK, COMPLETED
  priority: String,            // Low, Normal, High, Urgent
  assignee: String,
  approver: String,
  due_date: Date,
  start_date: Date,
  progress: Number,            // 0-100
  is_public: Boolean,
  child_count: Number,         // Calculated field
  tenantId: String,
  userId: String,
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
}
```

#### projectActivities
```javascript
{
  project_id: String,
  subject: String,
  type: String,                // MILESTONE, PHASE, TASK
  description: String,
  status: String,              // New, In Progress, On Hold, Completed, Cancelled
  priority: String,
  assignee: String,
  approver: String,
  due_date: Date,
  start_date: Date,
  end_date: Date,
  progress: Number,
  estimated_time: String,
  spent_time: Number,
  tenantId: String,
  userId: String,
  created_at: Date,
  updated_at: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Projects
- `POST /api/projects/projects` - Create project
- `GET /api/projects/projects` - List projects (paginated, filterable)
- `GET /api/projects/projects/tree` - Get hierarchical tree
- `GET /api/projects/projects/{id}` - Get project by ID
- `PUT /api/projects/projects/{id}` - Update project
- `DELETE /api/projects/projects/{id}` - Delete project

### Activities
- `POST /api/projects/activities` - Create activity
- `GET /api/projects/activities` - List activities (paginated, filterable)
- `GET /api/projects/activities/{id}` - Get activity by ID
- `PUT /api/projects/activities/{id}` - Update activity
- `DELETE /api/projects/activities/{id}` - Delete activity

## Key Features

### Tenant Isolation
- All data is scoped to the user's tenant
- MongoDB queries automatically filter by tenantId
- No cross-tenant data access

### Validation & Error Handling
- Project names required and unique per tenant
- Parent project validation
- Child deletion prevention (must delete children first)
- Comprehensive error messages

### UI/UX
- Material-UI components for consistency
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Loading states and spinners
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Success/Error notifications via Snackbar
- Breadcrumb navigation for hierarchy
- Tabbed interface for activity types
- Color-coded status chips
- Progress bars and statistics

### Performance
- Pagination for large datasets (20 projects, 50 activities per page)
- Efficient MongoDB queries with indexes
- Lazy loading of child counts
- Memoized React components
- Ref-based loading state management

## Design Patterns

### Following Existing Patterns
The implementation strictly follows the patterns from:
- `tool_config_service.py` - Service layer structure
- `tool_config.py` - Route definitions
- `ToolConfig.jsx` - Frontend component structure

### Key Patterns Used
1. **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from routes
2. **Async/Await**: All database operations are async
3. **Tenant Validation**: Reusable `validate_tenant_access` method
4. **React Memo**: Performance optimization
5. **useCallback**: Prevent unnecessary re-renders
6. **Loading Refs**: Prevent duplicate API calls
7. **Form State**: Single form object for create/edit

## Integration

### Dashboard Menu
Added to Dashboard navigation:
```javascript
{
  label: 'Projects',
  icon: 'FolderKanban',
  expandable: true,
  order: 15,
  children: [
    {
      label: 'Overview',
      to: '/dashboard/projects',
      icon: 'LayoutDashboard'
    }
  ]
}
```

### Routes
- Main route: `/dashboard/projects`
- Backend API: `/api/projects/*`

## Usage

2. Breadcrumbs show current location
3. Click any breadcrumb to navigate up

### Managing Activities

2. Choose activity type (Milestone/Phase/Task)
3. Create activities for specific projects
4. Filter by project ID in query params

3. See upcoming activities and progress

## Future Enhancements
