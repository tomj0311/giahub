# Project Management System - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Created

A complete project management system with:
- ✅ Hierarchical project structure (unlimited nesting)
- ✅ Project planning with Milestones, Phases, and Tasks
- ✅ Dashboard with statistics and visualizations
- ✅ Full CRUD operations
- ✅ Tenant isolation
- ✅ Material-UI themed components

## Files Created

### Backend
1. `/backend/src/services/project_service.py` - Project business logic

3. `/backend/src/routes/projects.py` - Project API routes
4. `/backend/src/routes/project_activities.py` - Activity API routes

### Frontend
1. `/frontend/src/projects/Projects.jsx` - Main component
2. `/frontend/src/projects/ProjectPortfolio.jsx` - Portfolio view
3. `/frontend/src/projects/ProjectPlanning.jsx` - Planning view
4. `/frontend/src/projects/ProjectDashboard.jsx` - Dashboard view

### Modified Files
1. `/backend/main.py` - Added project routes

## API Examples

### Create Project
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/projects/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Website Redesign",
    "description": "Complete website overhaul",
    "parent_id": "root",
    "status": "ON_TRACK",
    "priority": "High",
    "assignee": "John Doe",
    "due_date": "2025-12-31"
  }'
```

### List Projects
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:4000/api/projects/projects?page=1&page_size=20" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Create Activity
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/projects/activities \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_id": "PROJECT_ID_HERE",
    "subject": "Design Homepage",
    "type": "TASK",
    "status": "New",
    "priority": "High",
    "assignee": "Jane Smith",
    "due_date": "2025-11-15"
  }'
```

## Key Differences from OpenProject

This is a simplified implementation focusing on core features:

1. **Activities vs Work Packages**: We use Milestones/Phases/Tasks instead of OpenProject's work packages
2. **Simplified Gantt**: No Gantt chart (can be added later)
3. **Basic Time Tracking**: Simple estimated/spent time fields
4. **No Dependencies**: Activity dependencies not implemented yet
5. **Tenant Isolation**: All data is scoped to your tenant

## Troubleshooting

### Projects not appearing
- Check you're logged in with correct tenant
- Verify backend is running on port 4000
- Check browser console for errors

### Can't delete project
- Projects with children cannot be deleted
- Delete child projects first, then parent

### Activities not showing
- Make sure project_id is set when creating
- Check you're on the correct tab (Milestone/Phase/Task)

## Next Steps

The system is ready to use! You can now:
1. Create your project hierarchy
2. Add milestones, phases, and tasks
3. Track progress via the dashboard
4. Assign work to team members
5. Monitor deadlines and progress

For advanced features (Gantt charts, dependencies, notifications), refer to the main README for enhancement ideas.
