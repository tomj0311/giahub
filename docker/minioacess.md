Now that you've restarted your container, you need to run the MinIO client commands to set the bucket policy. Let me help you with that:


docker exec -it minio sh -c "mc alias set myminio http://localhost:8007 minio minio8888"
Great! Now let's list your buckets to see what you have:


docker exec -it minio mc ls myminio
Perfect! You have a bucket called uploads. Now let's set anonymous download access for it:


docker exec -it minio mc anonymous set download myminio/uploads
Excellent! âœ… Anonymous GET access is now enabled for your uploads bucket.

You can now access files using URLs like:

http://localhost:8803/uploads/your-file.jpg
If you create more buckets in the future, you can run the same command for them:

Your files in the uploads bucket are now publicly accessible via direct URLs without authentication!
